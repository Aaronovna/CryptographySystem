# Encryption System
## Made in Java using NetBeans


This program is dedicated to explore various encryption techniques for academic purposes, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of fundamental methods essential for information security. The contents focus on basic approaches such as Caesar encryption, alongside more advanced algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman). The goal is to clarify the basic principles and applications of each encryption type, culminating in the discussion of hybrid encryption systems. This academic section seeks to deepen understanding and appreciation for the role of encryption in safeguarding information integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity within the realm of cybersecurity.
